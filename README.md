# UE5_Dynamic_Vehicle_Camera
A small camera component for racing games in UE5

Just put the folder in a content folder of your project.
It contains the blueprint component for camera system and a particle effect for speed.

It set up to work with Chaos Vehicle Component but it can be replaced with any other vehicle component and used only to get the vehicle speed for particle effect. 

Just mark you vehicle body with a "Car" tag and your follow camera with "Cam" tag.
